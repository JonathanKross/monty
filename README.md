# Monty Hall Dilemma

## Objectives
After completing this assignment, you will...

- Understand randomness
- Understand the Monty Hall problem
- Be able to use the Python random module
- Be able to use randomness to perform a simulation

## Deliverables
A Git repo named monty-hall containing at least:
- A README.md file with a description and explanation of how to run your project.
- A monty_hall module.
- A unit test suite for advanced mode.

## Requirements
- No PEP8 or Pyflakes warnings or errors.
- Make sure your monty-hall folder has its own virtual environment (.envrc), but do not commit .envrc or .direnv to the Git repo.
- Also, do not commit __pycache__, *.pyc, or .DS_Store files to the Git repo.

### Normal Mode
Your task is to write that computer simulation. Prove that switching doors is best, by simulating 1000 games using each strategy and comparing the winning percentage.

### Advanced Mode (optional)
This assignment is challenging to break down into test cases you can implement in small steps. You also have to understand how to isolate the random elements and how to even make the code testable.

For advanced mode, figure out how to implement this with unit tests or test driven development. You might want to research mocks and stubs and find out the difference between them. This assignment might be easier to unit test with mocks.

Also, how would your code cope if the number of doors were increased? Try it out!
